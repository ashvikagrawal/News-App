# News-App

The Personalized News Aggregator is a Python-based GUI application that fetches and displays top news articles from various categories such as business, entertainment, health, and technology. Built with Tkinter, it allows users to select a category from a dropdown menu and retrieve real-time news from the NewsAPI. The results are displayed in a table, where users can double-click an article to open its full content in a web browser. This project enhances news accessibility by providing a simple and interactive way to stay updated with personalized content.
